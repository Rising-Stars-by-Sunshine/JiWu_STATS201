# README - City-Level Emergy Metabolism Accounts for China (2000-2020)

This dataset contains the emergy metabolism accounts for 281 cities in China, spanning from 2000 to 2020. Emergy analysis is used to evaluate the energy and material flows that contribute to the sustainability of a system. This dataset is valuable for researchers and practitioners working on environmental sustainability, energy flows, and urban development. It provides a comprehensive view of the emergy flows, offering insights into the material and energy dependencies of cities over two decades. The dataset was compiled by Miaohan Tang, Gengyuan Liu, and Jingke Hong, with their academic affiliation at Zhejiang University and other institutions.
